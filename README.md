# NODE-TS Starter
Acts as a basic foundation to do ts work.

## How to use

`npm install`  
`npm run tsc-watch` 

## Commands

### npm test
Unimplemented, doesn't work

### npm run tsc
Acts as alias to tsc package.  
Can be used for transpiling only once.

### npm run tsc-watch
Watch all files recursively if they need to be translipled.
Very handy for general use.

### npm run tsc-init
Use to generate tsconfig.json in root.  
Does not ever need to be run.
